# RegEx Experiments

This is a simple project in which I share regular expression tips.

They are written in PHP (and tested with PHPUnit), but should be translatable to most regular expression engines.

The project only has a test mode. It's not a library, and it doesn't provide any library or app-like functionalities.
The regular expression experiments are just added as PHPUnit test cases.

## 🔖 Prerequisites
* PHP 8.1+
* PHPUnit 10.5+
* Composer 2+

## 🚦 Setting up

Start by cloning the repo:

````bash
git clone https://github.com/markhj/regex-experiments
````

Navigate to the directory where the repo is cloned to, and run:
````bash
composer install
````

## 🍹 Run tests

After Composer has installed the dependencies, you can run the test suite with:

````bash
vendor/bin/phpunit
````

Unless I have messed something up, you should see nothing but tests passing 😊

Now, you can explore and play around with the regular expressions. Enjoy!
